Birdwatch provides bird sighting data based on a user provided location. 
The data is supplied by the Cornell University Department of Ornithology's ebird API, which is a collection 
of user submitted bird sightings. At the home page the user can submit a postal code or chose a state from a 
dropdown list in order to present another dropdown list of counties from which they can choose.

Once a postal code or county is submitted the user is brought to a page that displays the 12 most recent sightings
as well as a map of those sightings.There are options for each sighting to see the location on the map and go to 
that specific bird's wikipedia page.

Google account name and password. Once they are authorized they have the option to save bird sighting data for future 
reference.
